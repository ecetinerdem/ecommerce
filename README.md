This is an e-commerce website which Ä± wish to create for my fiance.

I will improve the readme as it goes along.

**Django is the corner stone and right now;**

- Add and update car possible
- Jquery added
- Cart summary added

- Payment app created

**What I am planning to add**

- User deletion
- Product recommendation
- Payment method
- User profile
- Wishlist

**To have and launch for yourself.**

- Get the code either cloning or downloading
- On your code editor, open a new window
- Open your terminal
- Create a Venv ''python -m venv {your environment name}"
- Go to directory where "manage.py" stays
- Run the command "python manage.py makemigrations"
- Run the command "python manage.py migrate"
- Run the command "python manage.py runserver"
- Go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
- For admin page go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin"

**Note**

I already created a super user for myself as admin so be aware of that. After migrations it will use that if you want to use the code all together just go ahead run the server without making any migrations!

To create your own superuser and the users. just delete the migrations file before running any commands!

Enjoy!!
